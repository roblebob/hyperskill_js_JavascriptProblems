<p>It has become quite challenging to come across websites that do not allow visitors to interact with them. These interactions can include sliders, web galleries, animations, or any other interactive event that appears upon pressing a button. These interactive behaviors are enabled by JavaScript, which helps process user input and send and receive data from servers. </p><h5 id="what-is-javascript">What is JavaScript</h5><p><strong>JavaScript (JS) </strong>is a widely-used programming language created by Brendan Eich in just ten days in 1995.
