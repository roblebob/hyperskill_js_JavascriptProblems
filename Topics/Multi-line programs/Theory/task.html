<h2>Multi-line programs</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>You already know how to write simple single-line JavaScript programs that output a line of text to the console. This is an achievement in itself, but real programs contain many linesâ€”from tens and hundreds for small scripts to several thousand for larger projects. After completing this topic, you will know how to write programs that simultaneously output several lines of text into the console.</p>
<h5 id="example" style="text-align: center;">Example</h5>
<p>Let's start with an example of such scripts. The following code prints precisely three lines of text, each from a new line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log("I");
console.log("know");
console.log("JavaScript");</code></pre>
<p>A line break can also be done using the <code class="language-javascript">\n</code> symbol:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log("I\nknow\nJavaScript");</code></pre>
<p>The output of these two code samples will be the same:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">I
know
JavaScript</code></pre>
<p>Try <a href="http://repl.it/languages/javascript" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">running</a> these scripts yourself to see that it works.</p>
<h5 id="empty-line" style="text-align: center;">Empty line</h5>
<p>The <code class="language-javascript">console.log</code> function also allows you to output an empty line without any information in it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log("I");
console.log();
console.log("know");
console.log();
console.log("JavaScript");</code></pre>
<p>Here's the output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">I

know

JavaScript</code></pre>
<h5 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Knowing how to write multi-line JavaScript programs is essential for larger projects. Using different functions and symbols, we can output several lines of text to the console in a single program. This makes our code easier to read and understand and enhances its functionality. In the upcoming topics, we will explore more advanced techniques for writing multi-line programs in JavaScript. There are other ways to print multi-line text that use just one function call. We will study them in the following topics.</p>
